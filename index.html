            <p>All companies across industries needs technical documentation. It doesn’t matter if it’s consumer-focused
                such as instructions on how to put together a dresser, or to your internal staff on the best practices
                for
                filing invoices – every standardized process needs proper documentation. Technical documents shows the
                user
                a lay of the product or process, explains what lies ahead, and teaches them how to navigate each step or
                challenge – all leading the user to the desired result.</p>
            <p>To fully explore the range of different technical documentation types, we’re going over 12 of the most
                common
                types of technical documents to guide your users around your product, explain your process to internal
                staff, and even improve your sales and marketing results.</p>

            </ol>
            <p>Before we go into each of these, let’s take a look at the two major categories of technical documentation
                and
                how they differ from each other.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Types_of_Technical_Documentation">
            <header>Types of Technical Documentation</header>
            <p>All types of technical documentation fall into three main categories: product documentation, process
                documentation, and sales and marketing documents.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Product_Documentation">
            <header>
                <ol>Product Documentation</ol>
            </header>
            <p>Product documentation encompasses in-depth guides, training manuals, and information that show users how
                a
                product should work or how to use a product.</p>
            <p>When most people say “technical documentation,” they are talking about product documentation. Product
                documents typically cover instructions and tutorials to help end-users accomplish a task. They include
                guides, illustrations, and reference sheets that cover:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Information on the requirements or system specifications users need to run the product efficiently
                </li>
                <li>Installation and usage instructions</li>
                <li>Frequently asked questions (FAQs) or knowledge base</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For product documentation, it’s recommended to leverage technical writing software and software
                documentation
                tools to create easy-to-use and help documentation.</p>

                <ol>Process Documentation</ol>
            </header>
            <p>Process documentation, on the other hand, is a document that shows an internal team what they need to
                know to
                properly execute a task. It covers information that helps create consistency and accountability within
                your
                organization, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plans, schedules, and notes that establish standards and patterns for different processes</li>
                <li>Reports and metrics that track project, staff, and resource performance</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="Types_of_Product-Based_technical_Document">
            <header>Types of Product-Based technical Document</header>
            <p>There are five major types of product technical documents; product manuals, user guides, repair manuals,
                API
                documentation, and SDK documentation.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Product_Manuals">
            <header>Product Manuals</header>
            <p>A product manual explains the parts of a product, where you can find each part, and what each part is
                used
                for. It essentially details everything a user needs to know about how a product functions.</p>
            <p>Although product manuals are most common with physical products — most of them contain product part
                diagrams
                and illustrations — they can be created for any kind of product.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Repair_Manuals">
            <header>Repair Manuals</header>
            <p>Repair manuals are technical documents that explain the correct way to fix a damaged product. Customers
                need
                them to navigate hardware problems or a combination of issues.</p>
            <p>When people deal with these kinds of situations, it’s helpful to have clear, concise information
                available
                that helps them through repairs quickly and efficiently, so they can get back to the work they love. To
                create an efficient repair manual, you need to anticipate every kind of product damage customers may
                face,
                then explain how to navigate it.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="User_Guides">
            <header>User Guides</header>
            <p>User guides are a popular type of user documentation that explains how a product works to users. They are
                handy during onboarding (especially interactive user guides) as they help users get their desired
                results as
                quickly as possible. User guides explain complex features and help end-users troubleshoot common issues
                using simple language and demonstrations so that the beginner can easily understand them.</p>
            <P>You’ll need to understand what users want to achieve in order to create a user guide that helps them
                achieve
                it and tailor your language to your audience. For example, if developers are reading your guide, it
                might
                make sense to include code samples. But a non-technical audience will need guidance they can understand.
            </P>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="API_Documentation">
            <header> API Documentation</header>
            <p>API documentation explains how developers can integrate other products with your product using an API
                (application programming interface).</p>
            <p>To create useful API documentation, consider the business value (i.e., what benefits will clients get
                when
                they use your product) as well as the technical requirements (i.e., how the client needs to be able to
                consume your API in order for it to function properly). You’ll need to include the functions, classes,
                arguments, and return types of your API in your API doc.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="SDK_(Software_Development_Kit)_Documentation">
            <header>SDK (Software Development Kit) Documentation</header>
            <p>SDKs are helper documents or libraries that describe the tools used to develop apps for a specific
                platform
                or product. Developers use SDK documentation to guide them when they create apps for a specific
                product/platform.</p>
            <p>To create your product’s SDK doc, you’ll need to compile a library of tools, compilers, debuggers, code
                samples, APIs, etc.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Types_of_Process-Based_Technical_Documents">
            <header>Types of Process-Based Technical Documents</header>
            <p>Process technical documents show your team what they need to know to execute specific tasks. Here are the
                types of process technical docs you’re most likely to encounter:</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Project_Plans">
            <header>Project Plans</header>
            <p>Project plans are docs that define a project’s goals and objectives and a map to help you get there. They
                describe every step you and your team need to take in order to complete a task or deliver a product.
                They
                help you stay focused on your overall goals and also put key dates in place, so you can track progress
                toward them.</p>
            <p>Project managers create project plans at the beginning of projects, whether that’s switching to new
                accounting software or creating a new computer program.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Business_Standards">
            <header>Business Standards</header>
            <p>Business standards are documents that define the rules, guidelines, and benchmarks your business should
                always meet in particular areas (e.g., customer service benchmarks, quality benchmarks, operations).
                They
                are used during employee onboarding and as references when need be.</p>
            <p>To create your company’s business standards, define your company values, explain how staff should respond
                to
                situations in ways that reflect your values, and set your organization’s benchmarks.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Test_Schedules">
            <header>Test Schedules</header>
            <p>Test schedules explain the steps, tasks, dates, and responsibilities involved in software testing. They
                are
                used to anticipate and assign resources: the equipment and engineers needed to run a test. Test
                schedules
                help to minimize the risk involved with software development because you are able to catch issues
                earlier
                with constant testing. They help to prevent accidents — or at least minimize the time those accidents
                can
                take place.</p>
            <p>To create a test schedule, first create a test plan that describes how tests are reviewed, tracked, and
                approved. Then list dates like release and beta entry dates.</p>
